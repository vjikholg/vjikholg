### "But I don't have the time and my ideas are not yet well developed on this immense terrain". 
I'm a math graduate from UBC interested in anything math-related, so that naturally led me to software/CS. I'm familiar with both pure and applied mathematics, as well as classroom experience with DSAs and software development.   

I'm currently working on a variety of things. My current project trio is: 
1. Finite-field serves as the computational algebra toolkit for generating matrix groups. I'm currently working on porting into TypeScript + testing multithreading via webworkers to increase group-generation times without resorting to using Shreier-Sims.
2. GN-scraper serves as the webscraping component scraping requisite generation information, as well as numerous other properties from GroupNames to feed into a SQL database/JSON file.
3. Cayley-Grapher serves as the front-end component, built using 3d-force-graph, to visualize the group generation algorithm and resultant algebraic structures.        

Besides that, I'm also familiar with C#/.NET from dissecting performance optimizing [RimWorld](https://github.com/vjikholg/Performance-Fish) mods, Python/Lua scripting from my take on [Tech-Annihilation](https://github.com/vjikholg/TA-recursive) (as well as a touch of C++ from reading and dissecting source code from the Recoil engine). 

You can reach me fastest through Discord: aGFwcGllc3RwdXBwZXIK (base64). 

Outside of math and coding, I like [astrophotography](https://imgur.com/a/Gq3OFah).
